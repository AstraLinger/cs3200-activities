1) Install pip if you do not have it:

	https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/


2) To install necessary python dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

You may need to `sudo ...`, depending on your folder permissions.
If you would prefer to install only for the current user, you can instead:

	pip install --user -r requirements.txt


3) Once the dependencies are installed, launch jupyter by navigating to this directory and doing:

	jupyter notebook
